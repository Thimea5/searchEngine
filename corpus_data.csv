Its definition is a transfinite development of some equivalent reformulation of the Baire space definition.

102	The Fock space as a de Branges-Rovnyak space. We show that de Branges-Rovnyak spaces include as special cases a number of spaces, such as the Hardy space, the Fock space, the Hardy-Sobolev space and the Dirichlet space. We present a general framework in which all these spaces can be obtained by specializing a sequence that appears in the construction. We show how to exploit this approach to solve interpolation problems in the Fock space.	arxiv
103	Admissibly Represented Spaces and Qcb-Spaces. A basic concept of Type Two Theory of Effectivity (TTE) is the notion of an admissibly represented space. Admissibly represented spaces are closely related to qcb-spaces. The latter form a well-behaved subclass of topological spaces. We give a survey of basic facts about Type Two Theory of Effectivity, admissibly represented spaces, qcb-spaces and effective qcb-spaces. Moreover, we discuss the relationship of qcb-spaces to other categories relevant to Computable Analysis.	arxiv
104	On Multi-Vector Spaces. A Smarandache multi-space is a union of $n$ spaces $A_1,A_2,..., A_n$ with some additional conditions holding.

Some characteristics of a multi-vector space are obtained in this paper.	arxiv

Some characteristics of a multi-metric space are obtained and Banach's fixed-point theorem is generalized in this paper.	arxiv
106	Tangent spaces to metric spaces and to their subspaces. We investigate a tangent space at a point of a general metric space and metric space valued derivatives.

108	Generalized Universal Covers of Uniform Spaces. We develop a generalized covering space theory for a class of uniform spaces called coverable spaces. Coverable spaces include all geodesic metric spaces, connected and locally pathwise connected compact topological spaces, in particular Peano continua, as well as more pathological spaces like the topologist's sine curve. Each coverable space has a generalized universal cover with universal and lifting properties. Associated with this generalized universal cover is a functorial uniform space invariant called the deck group, which is related to the classical fundamental group by a natural homomorphism. We obtain some specific results for one-dimensional spaces. Keywords: universal cover, uniform space, geodesic space, fundamental group	arxiv
109	Partial b_{v}(s) and b_{v}(Œ∏) metric spaces and related fixed   point theorems. In this paper, we introduced two new generalized metric spaces called partial b_{v}(s) and b_{v}({\theta}) metric spaces which extend b_{v}(s) metric space, b-metric space, rectangular metric space, v-generalized metric space, partial metric space, partial b-metric space, partial rectangular b-metric space and so on. We proved some famous theorems such as Banach, Kannan and Reich fixed point theorems in these spaces. Also, we give definition of partial v-generalized metric space and show that these fixed point theorems are valid in this space. We also give numerical examples to support our definitions. Our results generalize several corresponding results in literature.	arxiv
110	Reflexivity of a Banach Space with a Countable Vector Space Basis. All most all the function spaces over real or complex domains and spaces of sequences, that arise in practice as examples of normed complete linear spaces (Banach spaces), are reflexive. These Banach spaces are dual to their respective spaces of continuous linear functionals over the corresponding Banach spaces. For each of these Banach spaces, a countable vector space basis exists, which is responsible for their reflexivity. In this paper, a specific criterion for reflexivity of a Banach space with a countable vector space basis is presented.	arxiv
111	QFS-space and its properties. In this paper, the concept of quasi-finitely separating map and quasiapproximate identity are introduced. Based on these concepts, QFS-spaces and quasicontinuous maps are defined. Properties and characterizations of QFS-spaces are explored. Main results are: (1) Each QFS-space is quasicontinuous space; (2) Closed subspaces, quasicontinuous projection spaces of QFS-spaces are QFS-spaces; (3) Continuous retracts of QFS-spaces are QFS-spaces and a kind of retracts of QFS-spaces are constructed; (4) Upper powerspaces of continuous QFS-spaces are FS-spaces.	arxiv
112	Metric spaces with unique pretangent spaces. We find necessary and sufficient conditions under which an arbitrary metric space $X$ has a unique pretangent space at the marked point $a\in X$.   Key words: Metric spaces; Tangent spaces to metric spaces; Uniqueness of tangent metric spaces; Tangent space to the Cantor set.	arxiv
113	Best approximation with wavelets in weighted Orlicz spaces. Democracy functions of wavelet admissible bases are computed for weighted Orlicz Spaces in terms of its fundamental function. In particular, we prove that these bases are greedy if and only if the Orlicz space is a Lebesgue space. Also, sharp embeddings for the approximation spaces are given in terms of weighted discrete Lorentz spaces. For Lebesgue spaces the approximation spaces are identified with weighted Besov spaces.	arxiv
114	Asymptotically Scattered Spaces. We define thin and asymptotically scattered metric spaces as asymptotic counterparts of discrete and scattered metric spaces respectively. We characterize asymptotically scattered spaces in terms of prohibited subspaces, and classify thin metric spaces up to coarse equivalence. We introduce the types of asymptotically scattered spaces and construct the spaces of distinct types. We transfer the notion of asymptotically scattered spaces to $G$-spaces and characterize asymptotically scattered spaces of groups.	arxiv
115	Quantitative coarse embeddings of quasi-Banach spaces into a Hilbert   space. We study how well a quasi-Banach space can be coarsely embedded into a Hilbert space. Given any quasi-Banach space X which coarsely embeds into a Hilbert space, we compute its Hilbert space compression exponent. We also show that the Hilbert space compression exponent of X is equal to the supremum of the amounts of snowflakings of X which admit a bi-Lipschitz embedding into a Hilbert space.	arxiv
116	Biharmonic space-like hypersurfaces in pseudo-Riemannian space. We classify the space-like biharmonic surfaces in 3-dimension pseudo-Riemannian space form, and construct explicit examples of proper biharmonic hypersurfaces in general ADS space.	arxiv
117	Non-reflective categories of some kinds of weakly sober spaces. Ern\'e weakened the concept of sobriety in order to extend the theory of sober spaces and locally hypercompact spaces to situations where directed joins were missing, and introduced and discussed three kinds of non-sober spaces: cut spaces, weakly sober spaces, and quasisober spaces. Three other kinds of non-sober spaces, namely $\mathsf{DC}$ space, $\mathsf{RD}$ space and $\mathsf{WD}$ space, were introduced and investigated by Xu, Shen, Xi and Zhao. All these six kinds of spaces are strictly weaker than sober spaces. In this paper, it is shown that none of the category of all $\mathsf{DC}$ spaces, that of all $\mathsf{RD}$ spaces, that of all $\mathsf{WD}$ spaces, that of all quasisober spaces, that of all weakly spaces and that of all cut spaces is reflective in the category of all $T_0$ spaces with continuous mappings.	arxiv
118	On $T_0$ spaces determined by well-filtered spaces. We first introduce and study two new classes of subsets in $T_0$ spaces - Rudin sets and $\wdd$ sets lying between the class of all closures of directed subsets and that of irreducible closed subsets. Using such subsets, we define three new types of topological spaces - $\mathsf{DC}$ spaces, Rudin spaces and $\wdd$ spaces. The class of Rudin spaces lie between the class of $\wdd$ spaces and that of $\dc$ spaces, while the class of $\dc$ spaces lies between the class of Rudin spaces and that of sober spaces. Using Rudin sets and $\wdd$ sets, we formulate and prove a number of new characterizations of well-filtered spaces and sober spaces. For a $T_0$ space $X$, it is proved that $X$ is sober if{}f $X$ is a well-filtered Rudin space if{}f $X$ is a well-filtered $\mathsf{WD}$ space. We also prove that every locally compact $T_0$ space is a Rudin space, and every core compact $T_0$ space is a $\wdd$ space. One immediate corollary is that every core compact well-filtered space is sober, giving a positive answer to Jia-Jung problem. Using $\wdd$ sets, we present a more directed construction of the well-filtered reflections of $T_0$ spaces, and prove that the products of any collection of well-filtered spaces are well-filtered. Our study also leads to a number of problems, whose answering will deepen our understanding of the related spaces and structures.	arxiv
119	On Function Spaces Related to H-sober Spaces. In this paper, we mainly study the function spaces related to H-sober spaces. For an irreducible subset system H and $T_{0}$ spaces $X$ and $Y$, it is proved that $Y$ is H-sober iff the function space $\mathbb{C}(X, Y)$ of all continuous functions $f : X\longrightarrow Y$ equipped with the topology of pointwise convergence is H-sober iff the function space $\mathbb{C}(X, Y)$ equipped with the Isbell topology is H-sober. One immediate corollary is that for a $T_{0}$ space $X$, $Y$ is a sober space (resp., $d$-space, well-filtered space) iff the function space $\mathbb{C}(X, Y)$ equipped with the topology of pointwise convergence is a sober space (resp., $d$-space, well-filtered space) iff the function space $\mathbb{C}(X, Y)$ equipped with the the Isbell topology is a sober space (resp., $d$-space, well-filtered space). It is shown that $T_{0}$ spaces $X$ and $Y$, if the function space $\mathbb{C}(X, Y)$ equipped with the compact-open topology is H-sober, then $Y$ is H-sober. The function space $\mathbb{C}(X, Y)$ equipped with the Scott topology is also discussed.	arxiv
120	Order bornological spaces and order ultrabornological spaces. Ordered locally convex spaces is an important classes of spaces in the theory of ordered topological vector spaces just as locally convex spaces in the theory of topological vector spaces. Some special classes of ordered locally convex spaces such as order infrabarrelled spaces have been studied. The purpose of this paper is to initiate the study of order bornological spaces and their fundamental properties. In addition, order ultrabornological spaces is also investigated as an important special class of order bornological spaces.	arxiv
121	Homotopy of ringed finite spaces. A ringed finite space is a ringed space whose underlying topological space is finite. The category of ringed finite spaces contains, fully faithfully, the category of finite topological spaces and the category of affine schemes. Any ringed space, endowed with a finite open covering, produces a ringed finite space. We study the homotopy of ringed finite spaces, extending Stong's homotopy classification of finite topological spaces to ringed finite spaces. We also prove that the category of quasi-coherent modules on a ringed finite space is a homotopy invariant.	arxiv
122	On H-sober spaces and H-sobrifications of $T_0$ spaces. In this paper, we provide a uniform approach to $d$-spaces, sober spaces and well-filtered spaces, and develop a general framework for dealing with all these spaces. For a subset system H, the theory of H-sober spaces and super H-sober spaces is established, and a direct construction of the H-sobrifcations and super H-sobrifications of $T_0$ spaces is given. Therefore, the category of all H-sober spaces is reflective in $\mathbf{Top}_0$, and the category of all super H-sober spaces is also reflective in $\mathbf{Top}_0$ if H has a natural property (called property M). It is shown that the H-sobrification preserves finite products of $T_0$ spaces, and the super H-sobrification preserves finite products of $T_0$ spaces if H has property M.	arxiv
123	Holomorphic function spaces on the Hartogs triangle. The definition of classical holomorphic function spaces such as the Hardy space or the Dirichlet space on the Hartogs triangle is not canonical. In this paper we introduce a natural family of holomorphic function spaces on the Hartogs triangle which includes some weighted Bergman spaces, a candidate Hardy space and a candidate Dirichlet space. For the weighted Bergman spaces and the Hardy space we study the $L^p$ mapping properties of Bergman and Szeg\H{o} projection respectively, whereas for the Dirichlet space we prove it is isometric to the Dirichlet space on the bidisc.	arxiv
124	On Algebraic Multi-Ring Spaces. A Smarandache multi-space is a union of $n$ spaces $A_1,A_2,..., A_n$ with some additional conditions holding.

125	Ultrametricity and metric betweenness in tangent spaces to metric spaces. The paper deals with pretangent spaces to general metric spaces. An ltrametricity criterion for pretangent spaces is found and it is closely related to the metric betweenness in the pretangent spaces.	arxiv
126	Integral Operators in Grand Morrey Spaces. We introduce grand Morrey spaces and establish the boundedness of Hardy--Littlewood maximal, Calder\'on--Zygmund and potential operators in these spaces.

132	A nested embedding theorem for Hardy-Lorentz spaces with applications to   coefficient multiplier problems.

133	Rigged Hilbert spaces and contractive families of Hilbert spaces. The existence of a rigged Hilbert space whose extreme spaces are, respectively, the projective and the inductive limit of a directed contractive family of Hilbert spaces is investigated. It is proved that, when it exists, this rigged Hilbert space is the same as the canonical rigged Hilbert space associated to a family of closable operators in the central Hilbert space.	arxiv
134	Free spaces over some proper metric spaces. We prove that the Lipschitz-free space over a countable proper metric space is isometric to a dual space and has the metric approximation property. We also show that the Lipschitz-free space over a proper ultrametric space is isometric to the dual of a space which is isomorphic to c_0.	arxiv
135	$P_{Z}(S)$-Metrics and $P_{Z}(S)$-Metric Spaces. In this paper, we define notions of $P_{Z}(S)$-metric and $P_{Z}(S)$-metric space and we show that every $P_{Z}(S)$-metric Space, analogous to an ordinary metric space and generally, a $\Lambda$-metric space, is a topological space, and in continuance, we show that from a topological point of view, some properties of $P_{Z}(S)$-metric spaces, and $\Lambda$-metric spaces, have coordination.	arxiv
136	On the topological equivalence of S-metric and cone S-metric spaces. The aim of this paper is to establish the equivalence between the concepts of an $S$-metric space and a cone $S$-metric space using\ some topological approaches. We introduce a new notion of $TVS$-cone $S$-metric space using some facts about topological vector spaces. We see that the known results on cone $S$-metric spaces (or $N$-cone metric spaces) can be directly obtained from the studies on $S$-metric spaces.	arxiv
137	De Branges spaces and Fock spaces. Relations between two classes of Hilbert spaces of entire functions, de Branges spaces and Fock-type spaces with non-radial weights, are studied. It is shown that any de Branges space can be realized as a Fock-type space with equivalent area norm, and several constructions of a representing weight are suggested. For some special classes of weights (e.g., weights depending on the imaginary part only) the corresponding de Branges spaces are explicitly described.	arxiv
138	Generalisations of coarse spaces. Coarse geometry, the branch of topology that studies the global properties of spaces, was originally developed for metric spaces and then Roe introduced coarse structures as a large-scale counterpart of uniformities. In the literature, there are very important generalisations of uniform spaces, such as semi-uniform and quasi-uniform spaces. In this paper, we introduce and start to study their large-scale counterparts, which generalise coarse spaces: semi-coarse spaces and quasi-coarse spaces.	arxiv
139	A characterization of metric subspaces of full Assouad dimension. We introduce the notion of tiling spaces for metric spaces. The class of tiling spaces contains the Euclidean spaces, the middle-third Cantor set, and various self-similar spaces appearing in fractal geometry. For doubling tiling spaces, we characterize metric subspaces whose Assouad dimension coincides with that of the whole space.	arxiv
140	Some generalized metric properties on hyperspaces with the Vietoris   topology. We study the heredity of the classes of generalized metric spaces (for example, spaces with a $\sigma$-hereditarily closure-preserving $k$-network, spaces with a point-countable base, spaces with a base of countable order, spaces with a point-regular base, Nagata-spaces, $c$-semi-stratifiable spaces, $\gamma$-spaces, semi-metrizable spaces) to the hyperspaces of nonempty compact subsets and finite subsets with the Vietoris topology.	arxiv
141	Tchebyshev's characteristic of rearrangement invariant space. We introduce and investigate in this short article a new characteristic of rearrangement invariant (r.i.) (symmetric) space, namely so-called Tchebychev's characteristic. We reveal an important class of the r.i. spaces - so called regular r. i. spaces and show that the majority of known r.i. spaces: Lebesgue-Riesz, Grand Lebesgue Spaces, Orlicz, Lorentz and Marcinkiewicz r.i. spaces are regular. But we construct after several examples of r.i. spaces without the regular property.	arxiv
142	The Gromov-Hausdorff Metric on the Space of Compact Metric Spaces is   Strictly Intrinsic. It is proved that the Gromov-Hausdorff metric on the space of compact metric spaces considered up to an isometry is strictly intrinsic, i.e., the corresponding metric space is geodesic. In other words, each two points of this space (each two compact metric spaces) can be connected by a geodesic. For finite metric spaces a geodesic is constructed explicitly.	arxiv
143	Multipliers of Hilbert Spaces of Analytic Functions on the Complex   Half-Plane. It follows, from a generalised version of Paley-Wiener theorem, that the Laplace transform is an isometry between certain spaces of weighted $L^2$ functions defined on $(0, \infty)$ and (Hilbert) spaces of analytic functions on the right complex half-plane (for example Hardy, Bergman or Dirichlet spaces). We can use this fact to investigate properties of multipliers and multiplication operators on the latter type of spaces. In this paper we present a full characterisation of multipliers in terms of a generalised concept of a Carleson measure. Under certain conditions, these spaces of analytic functions are not only Hilbert spaces but also Banach algebras, and are therefore contained within their spaces of multipliers. We provide some necessary as well as sufficient conditions for this to happen and look at its consequences.	arxiv
144	On some kinds of weakly sober spaces. In \cite{E_2018}, Ern\'e relaxed the concept of sobriety in order to extend the theory of sober spaces and locally hypercompact spaces to situations where directed joins were missing, and introduced three kinds of non-sober spaces: cut spaces, weakly sober spaces, and quasisober spaces. In this paper, their basic properties are investigated. It is shown that some properties which are similar to that of sober spaces hold and others do not hold.	arxiv

147	Traces of Besov, Triebel-Lizorkin and Sobolev spaces on metric spaces. We establish trace theorems for function spaces defined on general Ahlfors regular metric spaces $Z$. The results cover the Triebel-Lizorkin spaces and the Besov spaces for smoothness indices $s<1,$ as well as the first order Haj{\l}asz-Sobolev space $M^{1,p}(Z)$. They generalize the classical results from the Euclidean setting, since the traces of these function spaces onto any closed Ahlfors regular subset $F \subset Z$ are Besov spaces defined intrinsically on $F$. Our method employs the definitions of the function spaces via hyperbolic fillings of the underlying metric space.	arxiv
148	Banach spaces of almost universal complemented disposition. We introduce and study the notion of space of almost universal complemented disposition (a.u.c.d.) as a generalization of Kadec space. We show that every Banach space with separable dual is isometrically contained as a $1$-complemented subspace of a separable a.u.c.d. space and that all a.u.c.d. spaces with $1$-FDD are isometric and contain isometric $1$-complemented copies of every separable Banach space with $1$-FDD. We then study spaces of universal complemented disposition (u.c.d.) and provide different constructions for such spaces. We also consider spaces of u.c.d. with respect to separable spaces.	arxiv
149	On RC-spaces. Following Frink's characterization of completely regular spaces, we say that a regular T_1-space is an RC-space whenever the family of all regular open sets constitutes a regular normal base. Normal spaces are RC-spaces and there exist completely regular spaces which are not RC-spaces. So the question arises, which of the known examples of completely regular and not normal spaces are RC-spaces. We show that the Niemytzki plane and the Sorgenfrey plane are RC-spaces.	arxiv
150	Hilbert Spaces Contractively Contained in Weighted Bergman Spaces on the   Unit Disk. Sub-Bergman Hilbert spaces are analogues of de Branges-Rovnyak spaces in the Bergman space setting. They are reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces contractively contained in the Bergman space of the unit disk. K. Zhu analyzed sub-Bergman Hilbert spaces associated with finite Blaschke products, and proved that they are norm equivalent to the Hardy space. Later S. Sultanic found a different proof of Zhu's result, which works in weighted Bergman space settings as well. In this paper, we give a new approach to this problem and obtain a stronger result. Our method relies on the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.	arxiv
151	"The log tangent space of the log jet space. We introduce new notions of log jet spaces. Mildly singular spaces are ``smooth'' in log geometry, so their log jet spaces behave like the jet spaces of smooth varieties. Myriad examples contrast log jet spaces with the usual jet spaces of schemes.   We then compute the log K\""ahler differentials of the log jet and arc spaces after de Fernex and Docampo. We obtain some of their applications to the structure of the log jet space. We conclude with comparison remarks with other log jet spaces."	arxiv
152	A Survey on Invariant Spaces of Holomorphic Functions on Symmetric   Domains. We present some old and new results on a class of invariant spaces of holomorphic functions on symmetric domains, both in their circular bounded realizations and in their unbounded realizations as Siegel domains of type II. These spaces include: weighted Bergman spaces; the Hardy space $H^2$; the Dirichlet space; holomorphic Besov spaces; the Bloch space. Our main focus will be on invariant Hilbert and semi-Hilbert spaces, but we shall also discuss minimal and maximal spaces in suitable classes of invariant Banach and semi-Banach spaces.	arxiv
153	Non-absolute integrable function spaces on metric measure spaces. Kuelbs-Steadman spaces are introduced in this article on a separable metric space with finite diameter and finite positive Borel measure. Kuelbs-Steadman spaces of the Lipschitz type are also discussed. Various inclusion properties are also discussed. In the sequel, we introduce HK-Sobolev spaces on metric mesure space which coincides with HK-Sobolev space in the Euclidean case. In application, we discuss the boundedness of Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator on Kuelbs-Steadman spaces and HK-Sobolev spaces over a metric measure space.	arxiv
154	Generalized-Lush Spaces and the Mazur-Ulam Property. We introduce a new class of Banach spaces, called generalized-lush spaces (GL-spaces for short), which contains almost-CL-spaces, separable lush spaces (specially, separable $C$-rich subspaces of $C(K)$), and even the two-dimensional space with hexagonal norm. We obtain that the space $C(K,E)$ of the vector-valued continuous functions is a GL-space whenever $E$ is, and show that the GL-space is stable under $c_0$-, $l_1$- and $l_\infty$-sums. As an application, we prove that the Mazur-Ulam property holds for a larger class of Banach spaces, called local-GL-spaces, including all lush spaces and GL-spaces. Furthermore, we generalize the stability properties of GL-spaces to local-GL-spaces. From this, we can obtain many examples of Banach spaces having the Mazur-Ulam property.	arxiv

156	A new series of compact minitwistor spaces and Moishezon twistor spaces   over them. In recent papers math.DG/0701278 and arXiv:0705.0060, we gave explicit description of some new Moishezon twistor spaces. In this paper, developing the method in the papers much further, we explicitly give projective models of a number of new Moishezon twistor spaces, as conic bundles over some rational surfaces (called minitwistor spaces). These include the twistor spaces studied in the papers as very special cases.   Our source of the result is a series of self-dual metrics with torus action constructed by D. Joyce. Actually, for arbitrary Joyce metrics and U(1)-subgroups of the torus which fixes a torus-invariant 2-sphere, we first determine the associated minitwistor spaces in explicit forms. Next by analyzing the meromorphic maps from the twistor spaces to the minitwistor spaces, we realize projective models of the twistor spaces of all Joyce metrics, as conic bundles over the minitwistor spaces. Then we prove that for any one of these minitwistor spaces, there exist Moishezon twistor spaces with only C*-action whose quotient space is the given minitwistor space. This result generates numerous Moishezon twistor spaces which cannot be found in the literature (including the author's papers), in quite explicit form.	arxiv
157	On the Spaces and Dimensions of Geographical Systems. To remove the confusion of concepts about different sorts of geographical space and dimension, a new framework of space theory is proposed in this paper. Based on three sets of fractal dimensions, the geographical space is divided into three types: real space (R-space), phase space (P-space), and order space (O-space). The real space is concrete or visual space, the fractal dimension of which can be evaluated through digital maps or remotely sensed images. The phase space and order space are both abstract space, the fractal dimension values of which cannot be estimated with one or two maps or images. The dimension of phase space can be computed by using time series, and that of order space can be determined with cross-sectional data in certain time. Three examples are offered to illustrate the three types of spaces and fractal dimension of geographical systems. The new space theory can be employed to explain the parameters of geographical scaling laws, such as the scaling exponent of the allometric growth law of cities and the fractal dimension based on Horton's laws of rivers.	arxiv

159	Performance Comparison between Network Coding in Space and Routing in   Space. Network coding in geometric space, a new research direction also known as Space Information Flow, is a promising research field which shows the superiority of network coding in space over routing in space. Present literatures proved that given six terminal nodes, network coding in space is strictly superior to routing in space in terms of single-source multicast in regular (5+1) model, in which five terminal nodes forms a regular pentagon centered at a terminal node. In order to compare the performance between network coding in space and routing in space, this paper quantitatively studies two classes of network coding in space and optimal routing in space when any terminal node moves arbitrarily in two-dimensional Euclidean space, and cost advantage is used as the metric. Furthermore, the upper-bound of cost advantage is figured out as well as the region where network coding in space is superior to routing in space. Several properties of Space Information Flow are also presented.	arxiv
160	Differentiable distance spaces. The distance function $\varrho(p,q)$ (or $d(p,q)$) of a distance space (general metric space) is not differentiable in general. We investigate such distance spaces over $\mathbb R^n$, whose distance functions are differentiable like in case of Finsler spaces. These spaces have several good properties, yet they are no Finsler spaces (which are special distance spaces). They are situated between general metric spaces (distance spaces) and Finsler spaces. We will investigate such curves of differentiable distance spaces, which possess the same properties as geodesics do in Finsler spaces. So these curves can be considered as forerunners of Finsler geodesics. They are in greater plenitude than Finsler geodesics, but they become geodesics in a Finsler space. We show some properties of these curves, as well as some relations between differentiable distance spaces and Finsler spaces. We arrive to these curves and to our results by using distance spheres, and using no variational calculus. We often apply direct geometric considerations.	arxiv
161	An Approximation Problem in Multiplicatively Invariant Spaces. Let $\mathcal{H}$ be Hilbert space and $(\Omega,\mu)$ a $\sigma$-finite measure space. Multiplicatively invariant (MI) spaces are closed subspaces of $ L^2(\Omega, \mathcal{H})$ that are invariant under point-wise multiplication by functions in a fix subset of $L^{\infty}(\Omega).$ Given a finite set of data $\mathcal{F}\subseteq L^2(\Omega, \mathcal{H}),$ in this paper we prove the existence and construct an MI space $M$ that best fits $\mathcal{F}$, in the least squares sense. MI spaces are related to shift invariant (SI) spaces via a fiberization map, which allows us to solve an approximation problem for SI spaces in the context of locally compact abelian groups. On the other hand, we introduce the notion of decomposable MI spaces (MI spaces that can be decomposed into an orthogonal sum of MI subspaces) and solve the approximation problem for the class of these spaces. Since SI spaces having extra invariance are in one-to-one relation to decomposable MI spaces, we also solve our approximation problem for this class of SI spaces. Finally we prove that translation invariant spaces are in correspondence with totally decomposable MI spaces.	arxiv

163	On rank-critical matrix spaces. A matrix space of size $m\times n$ is a linear subspace of the linear space of $m\times n$ matrices over a field $\mathbb{F}$. The rank of a matrix space is defined as the maximal rank over matrices in this space. A matrix space $\mathcal{A}$ is called rank-critical, if any matrix space which properly contains it has rank strictly greater than that of $\mathcal{A}$.   In this note, we first exhibit a necessary and sufficient condition for a matrix space $\mathcal{A}$ to be rank-critical, when $\mathbb{F}$ is large enough. This immediately implies the sufficient condition for a matrix space to be rank-critical by Draisma (Bull. Lond. Math. Soc. 38(5):764--776, 2006), albeit requiring the field to be slightly larger.   We then study rank-critical spaces in the context of compression and primitive matrix spaces. We first show that every rank-critical matrix space can be decomposed into a rank-critical compression matrix space and a rank-critical primitive matrix space. We then prove, using our necessary and sufficient condition, that the block-diagonal direct sum of two rank-critical matrix spaces is rank-critical if and only if both matrix spaces are primitive, when the field is large enough.	arxiv
164	Asymmetric free spaces and canonical asymmetrizations. A construction analogous to that of Godefroy-Kalton for metric spaces allows to embed isometrically, in a canonical way, every quasi-metric space $(X,d)$ to an asymmetric normed space $\mathcal{F}_a(X,d)$ (its quasi-metric free space, also called asymmetric free space or semi-Lipschitz free space). The quasi-metric free space satisfies a universal property (linearization of semi-Lipschitz functions). The (conic) dual of $\mathcal{F}_a(X,d)$ coincides with the nonlinear asymmetric dual of $(X,d)$, that is, the space $\mathrm{SLip}_0(X,d)$ of semi-Lipschitz functions on $(X,d)$, vanishing at a base point. In particular, for the case of a metric space $(X,D)$, the above construction yields its usual free space. On the other hand, every metric space $(X,D)$ inherits naturally a canonical asymmetrization coming from its free space $\mathcal{F}(X)$. This gives rise to a quasi-metric space $(X,D_+)$ and an asymmetric free space $\mathcal{F}_a(X,D_+)$. The symmetrization of the latter is isomorphic to the original free space $\mathcal{F}(X)$. The results of this work are illustrated with explicit examples.	arxiv
165	Domain-complete and LCS-complete spaces. We study $G_\delta$ subspaces of continuous dcpos, which we call domain-complete spaces, and $G_\delta$ subspaces of locally compact sober spaces, which we call LCS-complete spaces. Those include all locally compact sober spaces-in particular, all continuous dcpos-, all topologically complete spaces in the sense of \v{C}ech, and all quasi-Polish spaces-in particular, all Polish spaces. We show that LCS-complete spaces are sober, Wilker, compactly Choquet-complete, completely Baire, and $\odot$-consonant-in particular, consonant; that the countably-based LCS-complete (resp., domain-complete) spaces are the quasi-Polish spaces exactly; and that the metrizable LCS-complete (resp., domain-complete) spaces are the completely metrizable spaces. We include two applications: on LCS-complete spaces, all continuous valuations extend to measures, and sublinear previsions form a space homeomorphic to the convex Hoare powerdomain of the space of continuous valuations.	arxiv
166	Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin Spaces on Spaces of Homogeneous Type with   Applications to Boundedness of Calder√≥n-Zygmund Operators. In this article, the authors introduce Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces on spaces of homogeneous type in the sense of Coifman and Weiss, prove that these (in)homogeneous Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces are independent of the choices of both exp-ATIs (or exp-IATIs) and underlying spaces of distributions, and give some basic properties of these spaces. As applications, the authors show that some known function spaces coincide with certain special cases of Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces and, moreover, obtain the boundedness of Calder\'on-Zygmund operators on these Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. All these results strongly depend on the geometrical properties, reflected via its dyadic cubes, of the considered space of homogeneous type. Comparing with the known theory of these spaces on metric measure spaces, a major novelty of this article is that all results presented in this article get rid of the dependence on the reverse doubling assumption of the considered measure of the underlying space and hence give a final real-variable theory of these function spaces on spaces of homogeneous type.	arxiv

168	Intersection Space Constructible Complexes. We present an obstruction theoretic inductive construction of intersection space pairs, which generalizes Banagl's construction of intersection spaces for arbitrary depth stratifications. We construct intersection space pairs for pseudomanifolds with compatible trivial structures at the link fibrations; this includes the case of toric varieties. We define intersection space complexes in an axiomatic way, similar to Goresky-McPherson axioms for intersection cohomology. We prove that if the intersection space exists, then the pseudomanifold has an intersection space complex whose hypercohomology recovers the cohomology of the intersection space pair. We characterize existence and uniqueness of intersection space complexes in terms of the derived category of constructible complexes. We show that intersection space complexes of algebraic varieties lift to the derived category of Mixed Hodge Modules, endowing intersection space cohomology with a Mixed Hodge Structure. We find classes of examples admitting intersection space complex, and counterexamples not admitting them; they are in particular the first examples known not admitting Banagl intersection spaces. We prove that the (shifted) Verdier dual of an intersection space complex is an intersection space complex. We prove a generic Poincare duality theorem for intersection space complexes.	arxiv

170	Isometric structure of transportation cost spaces on finite metric   spaces. The paper is devoted to isometric Banach-space-theoretical structure of transportation cost (TC) spaces on finite metric spaces. The TC spaces are also known as Arens-Eells, Lipschitz-free, or Wasserstein spaces. A new notion of a roadmap pertinent to a transportation problem on a finite metric space has been introduced and used to simplify proofs for the results on representation of TC spaces as quotients of $\ell_1$ spaces on the edge set over the cycle space. A Tolstoi-type theorem for roadmaps is proved, and directed subgraphs of the canonical graphs, which are supports of maximal optimal roadmaps, are characterized. Possible obstacles for a TC space on a finite metric space $X$ preventing them from containing subspaces isometric to $\ell_\infty^n$ have been found in terms of the canonical graph of $X$. The fact that TC spaces on diamond graphs do not contain $\ell_\infty^4$ isometrically has been derived. In addition, a short overview of known results on the isometric structure of TC spaces on finite metric spaces is presented.	arxiv

176	Special symmetries of Banach spaces isomorphic to Hilbert spaces. In this paper Hilbert spaces are characterized among Banach spaces in terms of transitivity with respect to nicely behaved subgroups of the isometry group.

The spaces considered include Fock spaces, Hermite and twisted Bergman spaces and Segal-Bargmann spaces associated to Riemannian symmetric spaces of compact type.	arxiv
178	The cofinal property of the Reflexive Indecomposable Banach spaces. It is shown that every separable reflexive Banach space is a quotient of a reflexive Hereditarily Indecomposable space, which yields that every separable reflexive Banach is isomorphic to a subspace of a reflexive Indecomposable space. Furthermore, every separable reflexive Banach space is a quotient of a reflexive complementably $\ell_p$ saturated space with $1<p<\infty$ and of a $c_0$ saturated space.	arxiv

Because the orbit space is a locally closed subcartesian space, it has vector fields and their flows.	arxiv
